                    <p>I am a software developer, with a passion for helping non-profits manage their technology. From one page websites to custom built applications, I can build whatever your organization needs. I also work selectively with for-profit companies, when the right project comes along. I am a member of the Unifor Canadian Freelancer Union.</p>

                    <p>I specialize in Ruby on Rails, NationBuilder and Shopify. However, I am platform agnostic and can work with whatever tools we determine are the best solution.</p>

                    <p>I live on beautiful Vancouver Island with my partner and two dogs. I acknowledge with respect that I live and work on the traditional and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples, the traditional territory of the Quwâ€™utsun (Cowichan) Tribes.</p>
                        
                    <p>I spend my time restoring an old Jeep and running in the mountains. I use he\him pronouns.</p>
